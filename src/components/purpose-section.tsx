            What began as a single conversation quickly revealed a shared
            realization:
          </p>

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            In Bulgaria, and across much of the region, the space between people
            and democratic institutions has been growing.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-5">
            Trust in governments, NGOs, and civic structures has eroded. Many
            young people feel disconnected from decisions that shape their
            lives. Participation often feels symbolic, not impactful.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg font-bold my-5 leading-relaxed">
            That realization gave shape to DemPro.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Built at the intersection of education, civic life, and digital
            innovation, DemPro was created to rebuild connection where trust has
            frayed â€” and to give young people clear, practical ways to
            participate in public life.
